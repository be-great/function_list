## Strings 🧵

| Function  | Description  |
|---|---|
| `strcat`  | Function that concatenates two strings.  |
| `strncat` | Function that concatenates two strings using 'n' bytes from the source.  |
| `strcpy`  | Function that copies a string.  |
| `strncpy` | Function that copies 'n' bytes from the source.  |
| `strcmp`  | Function that compares two strings, with return values:  |
|  | 1. 0 for equal  |
|  | 2. Positive number for str1 > str2  |
|  | 3. Negative number for str1 < str2.  |
| `memset`  | Function that fills memory with a constant byte. Parameters:  |
|  | 1. `s` - the string  |
|  | 2. `c` - the constant value  |
|  | 3. `n` - number of bytes to fill.  |
| `memcpy`  | Function that copies the memory area of 'n' bytes from the source.  |
| `strchr`  | Function that locates a character in a string, returning its address.  |
| `strspn`  | Function that gets the length of a prefix substring. It counts the number of matching characters from the `accept` parameter until an unmatched character is encountered. Parameters:  |
|  | 1. `s` - the string  |
|  | 2. `accept` - allowed characters.  |
| `strpbrk`  | Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. It finds the first occurrence of any character from a specified set and returns its address.  |
| `strstr`  | Function that locates a substring. It returns the address of the found substring.  |
